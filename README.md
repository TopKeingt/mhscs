Malden High School Computer Club's source code

### Features
These are all things that I used to make this website:
- [Google Sheets Api](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/)(to get club's officers and members information)
- [Google Drive Api](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-sdk) (to get club's pictures and officer avatars)
- [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/) (to get club's events)
- [Netlify Cli](https://www.netlify.com/) (for deployment on public)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) based website
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) style sheet

### NOTE: 
- The project is currently in development and organization is require so take note as the code isn't complete perfect (*no one is perfect as well as their code.*)
- I replaced api keys in production so these keys are not available to launch (*you can generate your own in [google console](https://console.developer.google.com)*)
- colorlib template usage

### TODO:
- [ ] Convert to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and integrate with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
- [ ] Integrate [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to React for state management. 
- [ ] Paypal redirection
